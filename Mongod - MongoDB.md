MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. Instead of using tables and rows like in traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents

Each database contains collections which in turn further contain documents. Each document consists of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in a MongoDB database. A single collection can contain multiple documents and they are schema-less meaning that the size and content of each document can be different from each another.
